# Blur Network Code of Conduct

**To contribute to the Blur Network and its community, we ask that you that you hold yourself to the following ideals and their embodiment**

## Statement of Mission and Encouraged Conduct

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as
contributors and maintainers mutually agree to foster participation in our project and
our community to provide a harassment-free experience for everyone.  Blur Network
and its associated software is not intended for users who are not legal adults.  We promote
free-thinking minds, science-based conclusions, and getting your hands dirty to arrive at 
worthwhile answers.  We endeavor to establish a hardworking, truth-aligned network --
within our contributing developers, and our broader user-base.  Our community is inclusive
and welcomes all denominations, regardless of age, identity, body
size, abilty or disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression,
level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal
appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.  We endeavor to remove 
the barriers between our contributors and users, as well as any characteristics that any 
one may deem ancillary to their (physical or virtual) identity.

We do not align with deceit, censorship, or any realm of non-truth. We welcome all those
who seek to contribute productively to our network and its environment. 

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment
include:

* Focus on solutions rather than problems (the latter is inherent within the former).
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences, within reason.
* Accepting constructive criticism without adversarial confrontation.
* Focusing on what is best for the community, over the self.
* Acceptance of all other community members, their ideas, and their solutions.

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, personal altercations without reasonable cause
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic
 address, without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate or marginializing

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions
that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or
permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate,
threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces
when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of
representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail
address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be
further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported by contacting the project team at contact@blur.cash. All
complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that
is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is
obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.
Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good
faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other
members of the project's leadership.
